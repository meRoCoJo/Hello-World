# Hello-World
My first steps on Github

Now that I have some more time on hands I am taking some coding lessons to pick up an old hobby. First is to learn Python. In the past I learned COBOL and PASCAL. With COBOL I did'n't do much. With PASCAL I didn't do much neither but I did made a tool to help me organize the "Tour-de-France" game we organized at our work.
Maybe later I can tell you more about that.

For now I leave it at this.
